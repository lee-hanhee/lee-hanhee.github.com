                <h2>ESC204</h2>
                <p>Praxis III is the capstone course of the Engineering Science Foundation Design sequence and challenges students to apply
                the models of engineering design, communication, teamwork, and professionalism introduced and developed in Praxis I and
                II to the design and testing of a functioning product prototype. The course requires students to integrate the design,
                technical, and complementary knowledge gained across the Engineering Science Foundation in the context of a single,
                major, full-term design project.
                Teams in Praxis III choose from a curated set of opportunities that integrate technical and complementary
                considerations. They are responsible both for framing the opportunity and for designing and testing a product prototype
                that addresses the opportunity. Praxis III culminates in a public showcase where teams present and demonstrate their
                designs to their stakeholders and to the general public. All courses within the Foundation Design sequence use
                engineering design to provide a context in which students integrate their knowledge, develop their emerging engineering
                identity, and codify their individual approach to engineering practice.</p>

                mechanics. The basic conservation laws are derived in both differential and integral forms using different fluid models,
                and the link between the two is demonstrated. Applications covered include: dimensional analysis, hydrostatics, flow
                visualization, incompressible and compressible frictionless flows, the speed of sound, the momentum principle, viscous
                flows and selected examples of real fluid flows. The students conduct two hands-on laboratory experiments involving

                <p>Praxis I is the cornerstone course of the Engineering Science Foundation Design sequence and introduces the foundational
                models and tools of engineering design, communication, teamwork, and professionalism that underlie design education
                within Engineering Science. In Praxis I students work both individually and in small teams to develop their knowledge
                and skills in through a combination of active lectures, structured interactive studios, and hands-on practical sessions.
                The design projects in Praxis I are scoped to the individual student and the broader University community. Each student
                and team is responsible for both defining and resolving their own opportunities. Praxis I also supports students as they
                transition into their engineering studies and into the Engineering Science learning community. This support integrates
                conceptual models, concrete techniques, and University resources, and addresses both academic and non-academic concerns.
                All courses within the Foundation Design sequence use engineering design to provide a context in which students
                integrate their knowledge, develop their emerging engineering identity, and codify their individual approach to
                engineering practice.</p>

                <h2>ESC103</h2>
                <p>This course is designed to introduce students to mathematics in an engineering context, while exposing students to
                computational techniques. Topics include: vectors, lines and planes; 3-D visualization; matrices and transformations;
                matrix inverses, eigenvalues and determinants; solving linear systems; curve fitting and least squares; numerical
                integration and numerical solutions to differential equations. Course content is complemented with the use of MATLAB
                computational software.</p>

                <h2>ESC180</h2>
                <p>The first of two courses that introduce students to programming and computational thinking. Students will learn to use
                the Python programming language to implement computational solutions to problems, and will be introduced to the design
                and analysis of algorithms and data structures. Runtime analysis and searching and sorting algorithms will be
                introduced. Some computational problems will be drawn from other 1F courses.</p>

                <h2>PHY180</h2>
                <p>Mechanics forms the basic background for the understanding of physics. This course on Classical, or Newtonian mechanics,
                considers the interactions which influence motion. These interactions are described in terms of the concepts of force,
                momentum and energy. Initially the focus is on the mechanics of a single particle, considering its motion in a
                particular frame of reference, and transformations between reference frames. Then the dynamics of systems of particles
                is examined.</p>
