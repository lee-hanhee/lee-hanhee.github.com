                algorithms. Practical applications of these concepts were demonstrated through computational problems drawn from other
                foundational courses, providing a comprehensive introduction to computational problem-solving.</p>

                <h2>ESC194</h2>
                <p>ESC194: Calculus I provided a comprehensive exploration of differential and integral calculus, including limits, fundamental
                theorems, and elementary functions. The course also introduced the theory and applications of differential equations,
                laying a solid mathematical foundation essential for advanced engineering studies. The rigorous curriculum strengthened
                my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of calculus concepts critical to engineering problem-solving.</p>

                <h2>PHY180</h2>
                <p>PHY180: Classical Mechanics provided a fundamental understanding of Classical Mechanics, focusing on the interactions that influence motion
                through the concepts of force, momentum, and energy. The course initially concentrated on the mechanics of a single
                particle within a specific frame of reference, including transformations between reference frames, before progressing to
                the dynamics of systems of particles. This comprehensive approach established a solid foundation for further studies in
                physics.</p>
