                integration and numerical solutions to differential equations. Course content is complemented with the use of MATLAB
                computational software.</p>

                <h2>ESC180</h2>
                <p>The first of two courses that introduce students to programming and computational thinking. Students will learn to use
                the Python programming language to implement computational solutions to problems, and will be introduced to the design
                and analysis of algorithms and data structures. Runtime analysis and searching and sorting algorithms will be
                introduced. Some computational problems will be drawn from other 1F courses.</p>

                <h2>PHY180</h2>
                <p>Mechanics forms the basic background for the understanding of physics. This course on Classical, or Newtonian mechanics,
                considers the interactions which influence motion. These interactions are described in terms of the concepts of force,
                momentum and energy. Initially the focus is on the mechanics of a single particle, considering its motion in a
                particular frame of reference, and transformations between reference frames. Then the dynamics of systems of particles
                is examined.</p>
